# [Project 1: Analizing activity monitoring devices: Project Overview](https://github.com/emmarod1996/RepData_PeerAssessment1)
It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

# Project 4: Customer experience transformation
This project is about a QA transformation into speech analytics. QA in BPO field is a process that ensures someone is 
performing according the standards. it was posible to automate a process that was completely
manual, taking all the data extracted from calls thanks to speech analytics to a dashboard in PBI.

It was possible to trace the phone calls where some dissatisfaction was detected, classifying it into
several levels, depending on the severity.
